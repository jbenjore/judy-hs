INTRODUCTION
    What is Judy?

    Judy is a C library that provides a state-of-the-art core technology
    that implements a sparse dynamic array. Judy arrays are declared simply
    with a null pointer. A Judy array consumes memory only when it is
    populated, yet can grow to take advantage of all available memory if
    desired.

    Judy's key benefits are scalability, high performance, and memory
    efficiency. A Judy array is extensible and can scale up to a very large
    number of elements, bounded only by machine memory. Since Judy is
    designed as an unbounded array, the size of a Judy array is not
    pre-allocated but grows and shrinks dynamically with the array
    population.

    Judy combines scalability with ease of use. The Judy API is accessed
    with simple insert, retrieve, and delete calls that do not require
    extensive programming. Tuning and configuring are not required (in fact
    not even possible). In addition, sort, search, count, and sequential
    access capabilities are built into Judy's design.

    Judy can be used whenever a developer needs dynamically sized arrays,
    associative arrays or a simple-to-use interface that requires no rework
    for expansion or contraction.

    Judy can replace many common data structures, such as arrays, sparse
    arrays, hash tables, B-trees, binary trees, linear lists, skiplists,
    other sort and search algorithms, and counting functions.

INSTALLATION
  libJudy C LIBRARY
    The Perl CPAN module wraps the C library available at
    <http://judy.sourceforge.net/>. Download and install this prior to
    attempting to install Judy::HS. At the time of this writing, Judy-1.0.4
    happens to be the latest but I don't have any particular reason to
    prefer one version over another. If you have a newer version, give it a
    try.

    Fetch Judy from <http://judy.sourceforge.net>

      $ tar xzf Judy-1.0.4.tar.gz
      $ cd Judy-1.0.4
      $ ./configure
      $ make
      $ make check
      $ sudo make install

  Judy::* PERL LIBRARY
    Fetch Judy::HS from CPAN, <http://search.cpan.org>.

      $ tar xzf Judy-HS-...tar.gz
      $ perl Makefile.PL
      $ make test
      $ sudo make install

AUTHOR
    Judy was invented by Doug Baskins (dougbaskins .AT, yahoo.com) and
    implemented by Hewlett-Packard. (Note: Judy is named for the inventor's
    sister, after discarding many proposed names.)

    Judy::HS, the perl wrapper was written by Joshua ben Jore
